### Equivalence Partitioning:

- Equivalence partitioning divides the input domain into classes or partitions, where each partition represents a group of equivalent test inputs. Test cases are then designed to cover at least one value from each partition.
### Boundary Value Analysis:

- Boundary value analysis focuses on testing values at the boundaries or edges of input domains. Test cases are designed to include minimum, maximum, and values just above and below boundaries.
### Decision Table Testing:

- Decision tables are used when the behavior of the software depends on different combinations of conditions. Test cases are derived from all possible combinations of conditions, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
### State Transition Testing:

- State transition testing is used for systems with different states and transitions between those states. Test cases are designed to verify that the application behaves correctly when transitioning between states.
### Pairwise Testing (Combinatorial Testing):

- Pairwise testing focuses on testing all possible combinations of input parameters in pairs. It helps reduce the number of test cases while providing good coverage.

### Error Guessing:

- Error guessing is an informal technique where testers use their experience and intuition to identify potential defects based on past knowledge of common issues.

### Risk-Based Testing:

- Risk-based testing prioritizes testing efforts based on identified risks. High-risk areas are tested more extensively, while lower-risk areas receive less attention.

### Random Testing:
- Random testing generates test cases randomly to uncover defects that may not be apparent through structured testing techniques.
