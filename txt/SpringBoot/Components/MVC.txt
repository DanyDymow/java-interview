## MVC
In Spring Boot, the Spring MVC component plays a crucial role in building web applications. Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a web framework that provides a structured approach to developing web applications based on the MVC design pattern. It allows you to build web applications by separating concerns into three main components: Model, View, and Controller.

### Model:

The Model component represents the application's data and business logic. It encapsulates the state and behavior of the application.
In Spring MVC, the Model is often represented as POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) or JavaBeans. These objects hold the data that needs to be displayed in the user interface.
In a Spring Boot application, the Model can be any Java class or object that represents the data you want to expose to the user interface.
### View:

The View component is responsible for rendering the data from the Model and presenting it to the user. It defines how the data should be displayed.
In Spring MVC, views are typically represented as JSP (JavaServer Pages), Thymeleaf templates, FreeMarker templates, or other view technologies.
Spring Boot provides support for various view technologies out of the box, and you can easily configure and customize the view resolution process.
### Controller:

The Controller component in Spring MVC handles user requests, interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data, and selects the appropriate View to render the response.
Controllers are Java classes annotated with @Controller (or @RestController for RESTful services) and define methods annotated with @RequestMapping (or other specialized mapping annotations) to handle specific URL endpoints.
In Spring Boot, you can create controllers as Spring-managed beans, and Spring Boot's auto-configuration simplifies the setup of request mappings, view resolvers, and other configuration.
Here's a simple example of a Spring Boot controller:

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(Model model) {
        // Add data to the Model to be displayed in the view
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, Spring Boot!");
        // Return the name of the view template (e.g., "hello" resolves to "hello.jsp" or "hello.html")
        return "hello";
    }
}
```
### In this example:
- The @Controller annotation marks the class as a controller.
- The @GetMapping annotation specifies that the hello method should handle GET requests to the /hello URL.
- The Model object is used to pass data to the view.
- The return "hello" statement indicates that the "hello" view template should be used to render the response.
