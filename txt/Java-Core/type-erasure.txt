Type erasure is a fundamental concept in Java's generics system. It refers to the process by which the generic type information is removed (or "erased") from objects at runtime. Here's what you need to know about type erasure in Java:

## Generics in Java: 
Generics in Java were introduced to provide type-safety for collections and other data structures. This allows you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on typed parameters.

## Type Parameters: 
When you create a generic class, interface, or method, you specify one or more type parameters enclosed in angle brackets, like <T>. These type parameters allow you to work with different data types while maintaining type safety.

## Type Erasure Process:

At compile time, the compiler checks the generic type information for correctness and issues any relevant warnings or errors.
After the code is successfully compiled, the type parameters are removed (erased) from the generated bytecode.
This means that at runtime, objects of generic types don't carry their type information. They are treated as if they are just objects of the raw type, which is the class or interface name without type parameters.
Raw Types: Because of type erasure, Java supports raw types. These are types where the generic type information is erased. For example, if you have a List<String>, its raw type is simply List.

## Bridge Methods:
When you override a generic method in a subclass, the compiler generates bridge methods to ensure that the subclass methods have the same type erasure as the parent class methods. These bridge methods are used to maintain binary compatibility with pre-existing code that doesn't use generics.

## Implications of Type Erasure:

It allows pre-existing code that doesn't use generics to interoperate with new generic code.
It helps to avoid code duplication in generated bytecode.
The lack of runtime type information for generic objects can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, known as type erasure pitfalls. Developers need to be aware of these issues when working with generics.
## Workarounds: 
To overcome the limitations of type erasure, Java introduced constructs like bounded wildcards (? extends T, ? super T) and reflection. These allow you to work with generic types in a more flexible way.

## Type-Safe Operations: 
Despite type erasure, type-safe operations on generics are enforced at compile time. This means that if you attempt to use a generic object in a way that's not consistent with its declared type, you'll get a compile-time error.
