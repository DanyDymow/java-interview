Here's how Spring Boot works:

### Auto-Configuration: 
Spring Boot comes with pre-configured settings for many common libraries and technologies. When you add a dependency on such a library, Spring Boot automatically applies the corresponding configuration. This allows you to start development with minimal setup.

### Embedded Servers: 
Spring Boot includes embedded HTTP servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow. You can create stand-alone web applications without the need for external application servers. The embedded server is packaged with your application.

### Build System: 
Spring Boot uses either Apache Maven or Gradle as a build system to manage dependencies and build your project. This simplifies the management of libraries and the creation of executable JAR files.

### External Configuration: 
Spring Boot allows you to configure your application using external configuration files like application.properties or application.yml. This makes the application's configuration more flexible and avoids hardcoding parameters in the code.

### Modularity: 
Spring Boot supports modularity, enabling you to create small, independent modules (starters) and include them in your projects. This promotes code reusability and simplifies development.

### Built-in Tools: 
Spring Boot provides built-in tools for monitoring, application management, and more. For example, Spring Boot Actuator allows you to inspect the application's health and state.

### Exception Handling: 
Spring Boot provides default exception handling and logging, making debugging and error detection more straightforward.

### Dependency Injection: 
Spring Boot makes dependency injection easy with annotations, resulting in cleaner and more understandable code.
