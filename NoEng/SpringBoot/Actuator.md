Spring Actuator is a cool feature of Spring Boot with the help of which you can see what is happening inside a running application. So, whenever you want to debug your application, and need to analyze the logs you need to understand what is happening in the application right? In such a scenario, the Spring Actuator provides easy access to features such as identifying beans, CPU usage, etc. The Spring Actuator provides a very easy way to access the production-ready REST points and fetch all kinds of information from the web. These points are secured using Spring Securityâ€™s content negotiation strategy.
