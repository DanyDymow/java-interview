- Tell me about yourself

- A time you had to overcome adversity

On my last project. When I was working as a test engineer while still in a middle position, I was given a rather difficult task. It was necessary to write a test taking into account geopositional points and a geometric building. Since I worked on a project related to maps, in addition to everything, the test had to check almost the entire world. I was limited in time and the test had to show good operating time. I had several options for writing this test, but I couldn’t choose which one was better and which one would give the best test time and quality. So I decided to hold a meeting with the lead to discuss possible solutions. I also invited the signor to get the opinion of a more experienced colleague. After discussion, we identified the strengths of the two methods and combined them. As a result, I managed to complete this test on time and it showed an acceptable time for clients and also had the smallest error rate

- Give me an example of when you had a conflict with someone on your team and what the result was: 
Situation:
In my previous role as a software engineer at XYZ Company, I was part of a team developing a new feature for our primary product. The project was under a tight deadline, and each team member was responsible for different parts of the implementation. I was working closely with a colleague who was handling the backend services while I focused on the frontend integration.

Task:
We encountered a conflict when my colleague insisted on using a particular API design that I believed would cause significant complications and inefficiencies in the frontend development. I was concerned that his approach would lead to performance issues and make the frontend codebase harder to maintain.

Action:
To address the conflict, I scheduled a meeting with my colleague to discuss our perspectives in detail. I presented my concerns with data and examples to illustrate the potential impact on performance and maintainability. I also listened carefully to his rationale for preferring his design, acknowledging his valid points. We then brainstormed possible solutions together, aiming to find a compromise that would satisfy both of our requirements.

After a productive discussion, we agreed to involve a senior engineer to provide a third perspective. The senior engineer helped us evaluate both approaches and suggested a hybrid solution that incorporated the strengths of both designs while mitigating the issues we had identified.

Result:
By approaching the conflict collaboratively and seeking input from a senior engineer, we were able to design an API that was efficient and easy to integrate with the frontend. This not only resolved our conflict but also led to a better overall solution for the project. The feature was successfully completed on time, and the performance metrics met our targets. Additionally, this experience improved our working relationship and team cohesion, as we developed a deeper respect for each other's expertise and perspectives.

- Why Microsoft?

Microsoft is the world's technology services leader. Their products are used by millions of people. I grew up on their products; we have been using Windows and Word since school. And I honestly want to take part in the development of products that can have such an impact on the world and so many people will use them. On the other hand, I want to try my hand at working with such a giant and find out whether my skills will be useful to such a company
--------------------------

- What is your favorite Microsoft product and why

Cost: Microsoft Word is not free and requires a paid license or subscription to access the full set of features. This cost may be a disadvantage for individuals or organizations on a tight budget.
Compatibility issues: Different versions of Word may experience compatibility issues when opening documents created in older or newer versions. This may result in formatting problems or loss of content.
Learning curve: Although Word is easy to use, its extensive features and capabilities can be overwhelming for beginners. Learning to use more advanced features effectively may require additional time and effort.
Limited collaboration capabilities: Although Word allows collaboration, it may not be as robust in this regard as some dedicated collaboration platforms, such as Google Docs, which offer more real-time collaborative editing capabilities.
Resource intensive: Microsoft Word can be resource intensive, especially when working with large documents or complex formatting. Older computers and devices may experience performance issues.
Native format: Word documents are saved in a native format (.docx), which can be problematic when shared with people who don't have access to Word or when using alternative software.

- Are you comfortable with working in a team setting? How would you handle a situation where there is a disagreement among team members?

- Tell me about a time you failed

At my last job, I had the task of implementing a certain module into a project for subsequent use by other team members. I found the documentation for this module and started implementing it. But I don’t fully understand why this module will be used in the future and what tasks it should solve. When the task was completed on my part, other developers began to use this module. They started contacting me asking for clarification on how they should use it and I realized that I had not implemented this logic in this module. As a result, the module was integrated but could not perform all the necessary functions. From this situation, I learned that we need to ask more questions and clearly understand why we need this or that function. What and how we solve with this approach
--------------------------

- Tell me about a time when you had to make an important decision with limited information

On one of the projects, after a fairly large update to production, we received a rather serious bug from a client with a small amount of information. This bug affected a microservice that we were not responsible for, but it was likely that our update could cause this problem. To solve this problem, we first held a meeting with the team on the client side who were responsible for this service but did not receive the necessary information. We put all our efforts into finding the problem and after some time we discovered a problem that, due to an update, one microservice stopped communicating with another service. We discussed this reason with managers and team leads and decided to make a quick hot fix and create a task to correct the problem
-------------------------

- What are your biggest weaknesses? strength based questions

I believe that my weakness is an extra test of my decision. Sometimes I have several options for solving a problem and can spend extra time checking which solution will be better, faster and more profitable, even if it is obvious at first glance. I can spend time writing a test and testing the memory or speed of some method in a place where it is not at all appropriate

My strength is that I am not afraid of challenges. I like to take difficult problems and find solutions to them

- How do you stay updated with the latest technology trends and developments?

- How do you prioritize your tasks and manage your time effectively?

I used to categorize tasks into four quadrants: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important. This helped me focus on what truly needed immediate attention.

I set specific, measurable goals for each task and established clear deadlines. For example, I aimed to complete the feature's core functionality by mid-week, address critical bugs within 24 hours, and allocate time for client presentation preparation daily.

I used a combination of tools such as Trello for task management and Google Calendar for scheduling. I broke down larger tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks and scheduled dedicated time blocks for each activity, ensuring I had time for breaks to avoid burnout.

Recognizing the importance of teamwork, I delegated some tasks to my colleagues when appropriate.

---------------------

- To talk about a difficult interaction with a customer and how did I manage to resolve it and learn from it.

- How do you build trust with other teams? What would you do if you needed to influence but could not control an outcome?

Actively listen to their concerns and ideas, and provide clear, honest feedback.
Demonstrate reliability by consistently delivering on commitments and meeting deadlines. When others can depend on your work and contributions, trust naturally develops.
Try to find opportunity to work together
Take the time to build personal relationships with team members outside of formal work interactions

- How would you describe the cloud to a child?

- Tell me about a time you had to come up with a creative solution to a difficult problem
How have you worked with colleagues you've disagreed with in the past?

Situation:
In my previous role as a software developer at XYZ Company, we encountered a recurring issue where our application’s performance would significantly degrade during peak usage times. This was a critical problem as it affected user experience and our reputation.

Task:
My task was to find a solution that would improve the application's performance under heavy load without compromising functionality or user experience.

Action:
Instead of focusing solely on optimizing existing code, which had been done previously with limited success, I proposed a novel approach inspired by caching. I suggested implementing a cache memory for most more commonly used data

This experience taught me the importance of thinking innovatively and exploring alternative solutions to complex problems. Not thinking only about specific problem but try to find completely another way how to solve it. 

- Tell me about a time when you were working as a team and one of your teammates was not as motivated as you were. What did you do?

- Open ended questions: what motivates you? What gives you energy in work; What is your leadership style? Or management style? How do you work? How do you prioritize?
