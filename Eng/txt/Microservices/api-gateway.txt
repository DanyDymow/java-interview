Api Gateway is one of the main microservices patterns that is used to provide a single entry point for external consumers to access services. It acts as a reverse proxy and routing layer that is responsible for request routing, protocol composition, and protocol translation, among other things.

The API Gateway pattern solves several problems in microservices architecture:

It separates external consumers from the internal implementation of services. This allows services to develop and scale independently without affecting external consumers.
It provides a single point of entry for external consumers, making it easier to discover client-side services and reduce the number of network calls.
It can address end-to-end concerns such as security, rate limiting, and caching at the edge of the architecture rather than scattering them across services.
It can combine multiple services into a single response, reducing network calls and improving client-side performance.
It can perform protocol and content type translations, allowing services to be implemented using different protocols and data formats.
