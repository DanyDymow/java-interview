## What is the difference between SOAP and REST?
SOAP:

A protocol by which computers communicate with each other using XML
- SOAP only supports XML
- SOAP does not support caching
- SOAP is slower than REST
- SOAP works over HTTP, but "puts the message in an envelope"

While REST:

- REST is a type of service architecture for network applications
- Supports many formats
- Supports caching
- Faster than SOAP
- The REST client is similar to a browser in functionality and uses standard methods
- REST uses HTTP headers
