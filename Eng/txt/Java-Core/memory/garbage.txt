## Garbage Collection in Java:

Garbage collection is the automatic process of identifying and reclaiming unused memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable or referenced by the program.
In Java, memory management is handled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and garbage collection is a key component of this memory management.
How Garbage Collection Works:

### Memory Allocation: 
When objects are created in Java, memory is allocated for them in the heap memory area.

### Reference Tracking: 
The JVM keeps track of references to objects. An object is considered reachable if it can be accessed through references from other objects or from the stack (local variables or method parameters).

### Mark and Sweep: 
Periodically, the garbage collector runs in the background. It marks all the objects that are reachable (live) and sweeps away (reclaims) the memory occupied by objects that are not reachable (garbage).

### Defragmentation: 
After sweeping, the memory is defragmented to ensure that it's in a contiguous block for future allocations.

### Why Garbage Collection is Important:

Garbage collection eliminates memory leaks and the need for manual memory management, reducing the risk of bugs related to memory allocation and deallocation.
It improves developer productivity by automating memory management tasks.
It helps prevent common issues like null pointer exceptions and resource leaks.
Java's garbage collection mechanism allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying too much about memory management. The JVM handles memory cleanup efficiently.
