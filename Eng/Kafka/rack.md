### Rack 
is a label that identifies the physical location of Kafka broke (CDN) rs. In Kafka, you can specify a rack for each broker using the broker.rack parameter to control data replication, preferably placing replicas on different physical machines or in different data centers.

Benefits of using client.rack

Reduced latency: Kafka will prefer that data goes to the same rack where the client is located, which reduces response time
Increased fault tolerance: With proper configuration of client.rack and broker.rack, you can improve fault tolerance by placing replicas in different physically distant locations
Better resource utilization: Proper load balancing across racks helps avoid overloading one physical location
