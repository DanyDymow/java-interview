What is the difference between Kafka and RabbitMQ?
RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka are two popular messaging systems, each with its own features and used for different types of applications. Here are the main differences between them:

1. Architecture
RabbitMQ uses message queues. Messages are sent to a queue, and one consumer pulls a message from the queue for processing.
Apache Kafka uses topics and partitions. Messages are sent to topics, which can be divided into partitions, and multiple consumers can read these messages in any order. Kafka is focused on large data streams and scalability.
2. Message Delivery Model
RabbitMQ: Messages are sent in queues, and each consumer receives one message. Messages can be acknowledged or rejected. RabbitMQ guarantees that a message will be delivered to at least one consumer.
Kafka: Messages are stored in topics for a long time, and consumers can read them in any order. Kafka guarantees delivery of messages to all consumers if they subscribe to a topic, and can allow old messages to be read multiple times.
3. Delivery Guarantees
RabbitMQ: Provides delivery confirmations and can resend a message if the consumer does not acknowledge receipt. You can configure different levels of reliability (for example, by using acknowledgments or transactions).
Kafka: Messages are persisted on disk, allowing consumers to read them at any time. Kafka guarantees message delivery given a specific replication and persistence configuration.
4. Performance and Scalability
RabbitMQ: Better suited for small to medium systems that require high reliability and guaranteed delivery. It supports horizontal scaling, but requires additional setup and management effort.
Kafka: Features high performance and the ability to handle large volumes of data. Kafka scales easily through partitioning and data replication.
5. Consumer Model
RabbitMQ: One consumer receives one message. If the consumer does not have time to process the message, it can be resent.
Kafka: Consumers can read messages independently. Kafka stores all messages in topics, and consumers can read them at any time. Kafka also supports the concept of consumer groups, where each consumer in a group processes different partitions.
6. Use Cases
RabbitMQ: Ideal for request-response processing, distributed applications, microservices with delivery guarantees, business processes with task queues.
Kafka: Used for data stream processing, big data integration, logging, monitoring, real-time event processing, and storing large amounts of data for later analysis.
7. Producers and Consumers
RabbitMQ: One producer sends messages to a queue, and multiple consumers can process these messages.
Kafka: Multiple producers can send messages to topics, and multiple consumers can read them simultaneously, supporting scalability.
8. Messages and Storage
RabbitMQ: Messages are removed from the queue after they are processed by the consumer. Message storage is usually short-term.
Kafka: Messages are stored on disk in topics until their expiration date (as configured). This allows data to be re-read.
