### What is the Partitioner interface for?
The Partitioner interface in the Producer API determines which partition of a topic a message will be sent to. The default Partitioner uses the hash of the key (if present) to select the partition, ensuring that messages with the same key are always sent to the same partition. Custom Partitioners can be implemented to control the distribution of messages across partitions based on specific business logic or data characteristics.


### What is the Broker log cleaner thread for?
The log cleaner thread in Kafka is responsible for performing log compaction. Log compaction is a mechanism by which Kafka removes redundant records, keeping only the latest value for each key. This is useful in cases where only the latest update for a given key is required, such as for changelog or database state maintenance. The log cleaner is run periodically to compact the relevant partitions.


### What is the Kafka Mirror Maker for?
It is a tool that allows data replication between Kafka clusters, potentially in different data centers. It works by consuming data from one cluster and pushing it to another. It can be used to back up data, consolidate data from multiple data centers into a single repository, or migrate data between clusters.


### What is Schema Registry for?
Kafka Schema Registry provides a RESTful interface for storing and retrieving Avro schemas. Schema Registry is used in conjunction with Kafka to ensure data schema compatibility between producers and consumers. This is especially useful when evolving data models over time while maintaining backward and forward compatibility.


### What is Streams DSL for?
Kafka Streams DSL provides a high-level API for stream processing operations. It allows developers to describe complex processing logic such as filtering, transforming, aggregating, and joining data streams. The DSL abstracts many of the low-level details of stream processing, making it easier to create and maintain stream processing applications.
