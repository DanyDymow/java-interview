##Helm
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that makes it easy to install and manage Kubernetes applications. It allows users to describe the application structure and its dependencies, making the deployment process more automated and standardized. Here are the main aspects and capabilities of Helm:

### Basic concepts
- Charts:
Chart is a Helm package. It includes all the necessary files to deploy an application to Kubernetes.
The Chart contains the metadata, templates, and configuration values ​​needed to create Kubernetes objects.
- Repositories:
Repositories are repositories where Charts are stored. Users can add repositories and install Charts from them.
- Releases:
Release is a Chart instance deployed to Kubernetes. One Chart can be deployed multiple times with different configuration values, creating multiple releases.
### Basic commands
- helm install: Installs Chart into the Kubernetes cluster, creating a new Release.
- helm upgrade: Updates an existing Release with a new Chart or changed configuration values.
- helm rollback: Rolls back the Release to the previous version.
- helm list: Shows all installed Releases.
- helm repo add: Adds a new Charts repository.
- helm package: Creates a Chart from local files.
- helm template: Generates YAML manifests from Chart without applying them to the cluster.
### Chart structure
- Chart.yaml: The main file containing Chart metadata such as name, version and description.
- values.yaml: Default configuration file. Users can override these values ​​during installation or upgrade.
- templates/: A directory with YAML file templates that are used to create Kubernetes objects.
- charts/: Dependency directory if Chart depends on other Charts.
- tiller: kubernetes component that turns a command from Helm into one understandable for kubernetes
### Benefits of using Helm
- Simplified Deployment: Helm automates the application deployment process, reducing the likelihood of errors and reducing the burden on administrators.
- Repeatability: Deployments become more predictable and repeatable since all required resources and configurations are described in the Chart.
- Dependency management: Helm makes it easy to manage dependencies between different application components.
- Updates and rollbacks: Helm simplifies the process of updating applications and allows you to quickly roll back changes in case of problems.
Examples of using
- DevOps: Automation of CI/CD pipelines using Helm to deploy different versions of applications.
- Microservices: Manage multiple microservices, each of which can be described and deployed using its own Chart.
Enterprise Applications: Deploy complex enterprise applications that require multiple dependencies and configurations.
