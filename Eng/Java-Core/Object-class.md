### Class

In Java, a class and an object are fundamental concepts that are used to create and structure your code. Let's define each term:

Class:

- A class in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
- It defines the properties (also known as fields or attributes) and behaviors (also known as methods) that objects of that class will have.
- A class serves as a blueprint for creating multiple objects with similar characteristics and behaviors.
- Classes encapsulate the state and behavior of objects.

### Object

Object:

- An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete, real-world entity created from a class definition.
- Objects have state (values of their fields) and behavior (methods that they can perform).
- You can create multiple objects from the same class, and each object can have its own unique state while sharing the same behavior defined in the class.
