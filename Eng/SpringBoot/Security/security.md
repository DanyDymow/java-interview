### Security
Spring Security is a powerful and customizable framework used for application-level security. It provides comprehensive solutions for authentication, authorization, threat protection, session management, and integration with other popular libraries and frameworks.

## Key Components of Spring Security
### Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. In Spring Security, this is achieved through the implementation of the AuthenticationProvider interface, which validates user credentials.
Various authentication methods are supported, such as form login, basic authentication, OAuth2, JWT, etc.

### Authorization:
Authorization is responsible for controlling access to resources in the application after a user has been successfully authenticated.
Spring Security uses authorization expressions (e.g., @PreAuthorize, @Secured) to define access rules for methods or URLs.

### Filters:
Spring Security uses a chain of filters to process requests and responses. The main class is DelegatingFilterProxy, which delegates requests to the security filter chain.
Filters include authentication, session management, CSRF protection, and more.

Multiple filters can be used by specifying @Order(2) for them.

### Threat Protection:
Includes protection against attacks such as CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and brute-force password attacks.
CSRF protection is enabled by default in Spring Security.

### Session Management:
Spring Security allows managing user sessions, preventing session hijacking, and configuring session handling policies.
This includes features such as maximum sessions per user, "concurrent" sessions, etc.

### Integration with Other Libraries and Frameworks:
Easily integrates with Spring MVC, Spring Boot, and other Spring components.
Supports OAuth2, JWT, LDAP, and other authentication and authorization protocols.

## Key Classes and Interfaces
### SecurityContext:
Stores data about the current user, including their credentials, roles, and access rights.
The SecurityContextHolder class is used to access the current SecurityContext.

### UserDetailsService:
An interface that loads user data by their username.
Implemented to integrate with custom user management systems.

### AuthenticationProvider:
An interface for performing authentication.
Custom authentication providers can be implemented, or existing ones like DaoAuthenticationProvider can be used.

### GrantedAuthority:
An interface for granting access rights (roles) to a user.
SimpleGrantedAuthority is a simple implementation of this interface.

### SecurityConfigurerAdapter:
An abstract class used to configure Spring Security components.
Typically extended by the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class for configuring security in web applications.

```java
Copy
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
            .withUser("user")
            .password(passwordEncoder().encode("password"))
            .roles("USER")
            .and()
            .withUser("admin")
            .password(passwordEncoder().encode("admin"))
            .roles("ADMIN");
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .antMatchers("/user/**").hasAnyRole("USER", "ADMIN")
            .antMatchers("/", "/home").permitAll()
            .and()
            .formLogin()
            .loginPage("/login")
            .permitAll()
            .and()
            .logout()
            .permitAll();
    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```

### Key Features:
In-Memory User Authentication: This example uses in-memory users.

Role-Based Authorization: The URL /admin/** is accessible only to users with the ADMIN role, while /user/** is accessible to users with the USER or ADMIN roles.

Custom Login Page: The login page is set to /login.

Password Encryption: Uses BCryptPasswordEncoder for password encryption.
