HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are versions of the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) used for data communication on the internet. The key differences between them lie in performance, efficiency, and functionality. Here are the main distinctions:

1. Multiplexing
HTTP/1.1: Requests and responses are handled sequentially. If a client needs to load multiple resources (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript), it sends separate requests for each resource. This can lead to delays due to head-of-line blocking.

HTTP/2: Supports multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent simultaneously over a single connection. This significantly speeds up page loading.

2. Binary Protocol
HTTP/1.1: Uses a text-based format for data transmission, making it less efficient and more prone to errors.

HTTP/2: Operates with binary data, simplifying processing and making data transfer more efficient.

3. Header Compression
HTTP/1.1: Headers are sent as plain text and are not compressed, increasing the amount of data transmitted.

HTTP/2: Uses the HPACK algorithm to compress headers, reducing overhead and speeding up data transfer.

4. Request Prioritization
HTTP/1.1: No built-in support for request prioritization. Browsers attempt to optimize loading, but this is not always effective.

HTTP/2: Allows clients to specify priorities for requests, ensuring that critical resources (e.g., CSS or JavaScript) are loaded faster.

5. Server Push
HTTP/1.1: The server can only send data in response to a client's request.

HTTP/2: Supports Server Push, enabling the server to send resources to the client before they are explicitly requested. For example, the server can send a CSS file along with the HTML to speed up page rendering.

6. Connections
HTTP/1.1: To reduce latency, multiple TCP connections (usually 6-8) are often used, increasing server load.

HTTP/2: Uses a single connection for all data transfer, reducing server load and improving performance.

7. Compatibility
HTTP/1.1: Widely supported by all browsers and servers.

HTTP/2: Requires support from both the server and the client. However, most modern browsers and servers already support HTTP/2.
