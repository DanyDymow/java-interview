- DNS lookup
The first step is to find the IP address where the resources are located. This is done using DNS lookup.

A DNS (Domain Name System) server is a server that is primarily used to map the host name of a website (eg: www.example.com) to its corresponding IP address. It contains a database of public IP addresses and their corresponding domain names.

For example, if you visit the page www.example.com, the DNS server will return its IP address (93.184.216.34).

Triple TCP handshake
The next step is to establish a TCP connection with the server. This is done through the TCP triple handshake.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - transmission control protocol. This is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain network communication through which applications can exchange data.

- Triple TCP handshake
Triple TCP handshake
First, the client sends a request to open a connection with the server using a SYN packet (from the English SYNchronize packet - synchronization packet).

The server then responds with a SYN-ACK packet (SYNchronize-ACKnowledge packet) to acknowledge the request and ask the client to open the connection.

Finally, the client sends an ACK packet to the server to confirm the request.

- TLS handshake
If the website uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), then the next step is to establish a TLS connection via a TLS handshake.

Translator's note. TLS (abbreviation for Transport Layer Security) - encrypts data sent over the Internet to prevent eavesdroppers and hackers from seeing what you transmit, which is especially useful for private and confidential information such as passwords, credit card numbers and personal correspondence.

TLS handshake
TLS handshake
At this stage, several more messages are exchanged between the browser and the server.

- Client sends "hello": The browser sends a message to the server with the TLS version and cipher suite it supports, as well as a string of random bytes called "client random".

Translator's note. “Client random” (as well as “server random”) is a string of 32 random bytes. According to the TLS 1.2 specification, the first 4 bytes are the current date and time, and the remaining 28 bytes are randomly generated digits.

- Server sends “hello” and certificate: in response to the client’s “hello”, the server sends its own hello message containing the SSL certificate, a cipher suite and a string of random bytes called “server random”.

- Authentication: the browser checks the SSL certificate received from the server for authenticity through the “certificate authority” that issued it. This way the browser can understand that the server really is who it claims to be.

- “Premaster secret”: the browser sends another string of randomly generated bytes called the “premaster secret”, which is encrypted with a public key obtained from the server’s SSL certificate. The "premaster secret" can only be decrypted using the server's private key.

- Using a private key: the server decrypts the “premaster secret”.

- Creation of session keys: the browser and server generate session keys based on the “client random”, “server random” and “premaster secret”.

- The client completes the handshake process: the browser sends a message to the server to complete the process.

- The server completes the handshake process: The server also sends a message to the client indicating that the process has completed from its end.

- Symmetric encryption security has been achieved: the handshake is complete and further communication can continue using session keys.

- Now you can start sending requests to the server and receiving data from it.
