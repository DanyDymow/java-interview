## Test principles

Principle 1 - Testing shows presence of defects.
Testing only reduces the likelihood of defects found in the software, but does not guarantee their absence.
Principle 2 - Exhaustive testing is impossible.
Complete testing using all combinations of input data, results and preconditions is physically impossible (except in trivial cases).
Principle 3 - Early testing.
Testing should begin early in the software development life cycle to find defects as early as possible.
Principle 4 - Defects clustering.
Most of the defects are found in a limited number of modules.
Principle 5 - Pesticide paradox.
If you repeat the same test cases over and over again, at some point this test suite will stop identifying new defects.
Principle 6 - Testing is context depending. Testing is done differently depending on the context. For example, security-critical software is tested differently than a news portal.
Principle 7 - Absence-of-errors fallacy. The absence of defects found during testing does not always mean the product is ready for release. The system must be user-friendly to use and meet his expectations and needs.
