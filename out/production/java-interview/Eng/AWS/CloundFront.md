Amazon CloudFront is a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) service from Amazon Web Services (AWS). CloudFront
used to speed up the delivery of static and dynamic web content such as HTML pages, images, videos and APIs to users around the world. This is achieved by caching content on geographically distributed servers known as Points of Presence (PoPs).

Main characteristics
### Global network:

CloudFront has more than 300 points of presence in different regions of the world, which minimizes delays and ensures high speed content delivery to users.
### AWS integration:

Deep integration with other AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, and AWS Lambda.
### Supports various content types:

CloudFront can serve both static and dynamic content, as well as video and audio streaming.
