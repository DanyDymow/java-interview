What is a CNI plugin and what is it for?
— The abbreviation CNI stands for Container Network Interface. It represents a certain level of abstraction over the implementation of the network. We can work with high-level abstractions like “POD IP address”, Endpoint. The CNI plugin is responsible for how this will be implemented at the physical level. There are many CNI plugins (for example, Flannel, Calico, Cilium) that implement different functionality and show different network performance. From the simplest ones, which use L3 routing, iptables and IPVS rules, to quite complex ones, which, for example, can encrypt internal traffic in a cluster, support VLANs, routing based on IBGP, EGRESS support, etc.
